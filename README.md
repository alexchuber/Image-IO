# Image-IO
Made Fall 2020

This was an exercise in file IO and image manipulation (.tga format) for my programming fundamentals II class.

The actual input files have been lost to time. So, unless I want to update this (old, naively-made) codebase... \
then this, too, shall be lost to time.

sorry that was so dramatic lol im tired
